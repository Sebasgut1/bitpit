<h1>A quick look at bitpit</h1>

<p>
Nowadays, every scientific field needs software applications that uses computing
capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. Even if the main objectives of all these applications
may be very different from each other, there are some functionalities that are common across a wide variety of
scientific programs. For example, applications that deal with finite volume or finite element methods
always use some kind of spatial discretization of the physical domain and thus require code to handle
computational meshes. Although essential, developing code to addresses these common tasks
is time consuming and subtracts time to the development of the main functionalities of the application.
</p>

<p>
Each module of the <strong>bitpit</strong> library is developed to address a specific aspect of real-life
application development. Modules can be used as building blocks to quickly develop a high-performance
scientific application. The library consist of several modules ranging from low level functionalities like
algebraic operators to high level capabilities like the evaluation of a distance functions on
computational meshes.

<strong>bitpit</strong> is an open source C++ library developed by <a class="optimad" href="http://www.optimad.it">Optimad

<h2>Mesh modules</h2>

<p>
All <strong>bitpit</strong> mesh modules are build upon the abstract mesh interface provided
by the <strong>PatchKernel</strong> module. In the same module, basic objects (like vertices,
cells and interfaces) necessary for implementing high level mesh capabilities are also defined.
The common functionalities provided by <strong>PatchKernel</strong> are then extended and
optimized by specialized mesh modules.

<span class="anchor" id="voloctree"></span>
<h3>VolOctree</h3>

<p>
<strong>VolOctree</strong> is the module that handles octree (three-dimensional) and quadtree
(two-dimensional) meshes. It supports non-conformal elements (i.e., hanging nodes), adaptive
mesh refinement and dynamic load-balance among parallel partitions.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="volcartesian"></span>
<h3>VolCartesian</h3>

<p>
<strong>VolCartesian</strong> allows to define simple serial Cartesian meshes.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="volunstructured"></span>
<h3>VolUnstructured</h3>

<p>
Unstructured three-dimensional and two-dimensional meshes can be generated using
the module <strong>VolUnstructured</strong>. Both standard elements (e.g., hexaedra,
tetrahedra, pyramids, ...) and polyhedral elements are supported.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="surfunstructured"></span>
<h3>SurfUnstructured</h3>

<p>
<strong>SurfUnstructured</strong> is the container for surface segmentations and
has methods to read, write and modify surface triangulations.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="levelset"></span>
<h2>Levelset</h2>

<p>
The <strong>Levelset</strong> module provides methods for evaluating signed and unsigned distance functions
from generic objects immersed in a computational mesh.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="RBF"></span>
<h2>Radial Basis Functions manipulator (RBF)</h2>

<p>
The <strong>RBF</strong> module allows to efficiently handle Radial Basis Function interpolation
and parametrization even with a large set of nodes.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="tree"></span>
<h2>Tree data structures</h2>

<span class="anchor" id="PABLO"></span>
<h3>PABLO - PArallel Balanced Linear Octree</h3>

<p>
<strong>PABLO</strong> implements a parallel linear octree/quadtree capable of
generating non-conformal grids with hanging nodes. It's the main building
block of <strong>VolOctree</strong> patch. Adaptive mesh refinement,
dynamic load-balance among partitions and 2:1 balancing between octants
are some of the main features of <strong>PABLO</strong>. Communication
of data defined on the octants is transparent to the user since the necessary
low level MPI calls are completely handled by the module.

<h2>Sort algorithms</h2>

<p>
The <strong>SA</strong> module defines some data structures useful for sorting
purposes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>a data structure for the insertion and the extraction of elements according
    to the last-in first-out accounting;</li>
    <li>a Kd-tree structure for sorting points of a d-dimensional Euclidean space;</li>
    <li>a binary tree which ensures that the root element always contains the smallest/largest value
    of the tree.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Input Output</h2>

<p>The <strong>IO</strong> module provides methods for reading and writing common data files like DGF (Dune Grid Format),
STL (STereo Litography) and VTK (Visualization ToolKit). It also provides methods for handling
console output and log files.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="containers"></span>
<h3>Containers</h3>

<p>
This module provides containers not present in the STL C++ library and specifically designed for scientific
applications:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>an associative container based on the STL vector which allows fast insertion and deletion
    of elements and guarantees that the elements are stored in a contiguous chunk of memory;</li>
